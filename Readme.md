A live-demo to explain the experiment. This demo will be useful for those who have not used QGIS before.

### Survey URL: https://forms.gle/A3f1T99fa6xvhBNG9

### Aim
The aim of this voluntary experiment is to investigate how we digitize building footprints.

### Duration
At most ~30 minutes.

### Prerequisite
QGIS 3 https://qgis.org/tr/site/

### Data:
* Under the `data/` folder of this repo:	https://github.com/banbar/building_footprints
* Original source: https://landcover.ai/

### Process:
*	Drag and drop the files under the `data/` folder to QGIS.
* Right-click on `self_buildings`and click `Toggle Editing`.
* Start digitizing the polygons that contain a point-of-interest (POI). The polygon IDs must match with the POI ID.
* Once you have digitised the four buildings, right-click on the layer again, and press `Toggle Editing` once more to save your changes.
* Upload the edited `self_buildings.geojeson` to Google Forms.
