# Digitisation of Building Experiments

## Date: 4 December 2021, 11:00

### Meeting URL: [https://meet.google.com/ukb-uokc-jmx](https://meet.google.com/ukb-uokc-jmx)
This meeting will be a live-demo to explain the experiment. This demo will be useful for those who have not used QGIS before.

### Survey URL: https://forms.gle/A3f1T99fa6xvhBNG9

### Aim
The aim of this voluntary experiment is to analyse how we digitize building footprints.

### License
If you agree to complete this experiment, you are willing to allow Dr. Berk AnbaroÄŸlu to analyse the building footprints that you digitised, and associate the results with the three-question survey information.

The building footprints you digitised would be made available online, so that the spatial analysis on building footprints could be reproducible.

No personal information (including the email addresses) will be shared with third parties.

### Duration
At most ~30 minutes.

### Prerequisite
QGIS 3 https://qgis.org/tr/site/

### Process:
*	Download this repo as a zip file and extract its contents.
* Drag and drop the files under the `data/` folder to QGIS.
* Right-click on `self_buildings`and click `Toggle Editing`.
* Start digitizing the polygons that contain a point-of-interest (POI). The polygon IDs must match with the POI ID.
* Once you have digitised the four buildings, right-click on the layer again, and press `Toggle Editing` once more to save your changes.
* Upload the edited `self_buildings.geojeson` to Google Forms.
